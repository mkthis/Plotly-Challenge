# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, an interactive dashboard allows the viewer to examine the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

JavaScript was used to read in the data to an HTML webpage. Plotly was used to construct an interactive bar graph for the top 10 colonies found in each participant's belly button, as well as a bubble graph to reflect all of the biodiversity in each sample. The plots were updated each time a new participant ID was selected.
